After sorting out the preliminaries for cyclic sextic field, we succeed in finding the integral basis for cyclic sextic field and giving an algorithm for prime decomposition. We also proposed many examples for cyclic cubic and sextic fields as well as some small theorems. On the other hand, using the Galois theory, we have prove two theorems for the Galois extensions over one-variable function field. The existence theorem is also a direct corollary of L\"{u}roth's theorem, and the explicit form given by the second theorem is very useful in finding the automorphism subgroups of a function field.
